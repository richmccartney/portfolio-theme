				                <p>Here is a short bit of JavaScript to check and replace your images based on device width. This will check the screen width and based on how big it is will load in a new image.</p>

<p>As you can see I've just set a three data attributes for each image size you will require. A future development on this will check if its a retina screen.</p>

<p>Star it on <a href="https://github.com/richmccartney/Responsive-images">GitHub</a> as well.</p>

<h3 id="jquery">jQuery</h3>

<pre><code>jQuery(document).ready(function($) {

var screenSize = '';

// Detect current devices width
function checkWidth() {

    var windowSize = window.screen.width;

    if (windowSize &lt;= 480) {
        screenSize = 'small';
    }
    else if (windowSize &lt;= 960) {
        screenSize = 'medium';
    }
    else {
        screenSize = 'default';
    }

}

// Sets the correct image based on screen size
function setImage() {

    var images = $('img');

    images.each(function() {
        var self = $(this),
            newSrc = self.data(screenSize);

        console.log(newSrc);

        self.attr('src', newSrc);
    });

}

// Execute on load
checkWidth();
setImage();

});
</code></pre>

<h3 id="html">HTML</h3>

<p><code>&lt;img src="image.jpg" data-small="small.jpg" data-medium="medium.jpg" data-default="large.jpg" alt=""&gt;</code></p>

<p style="font-size: 24px; line-height: 36px;">So London JS 2014 has been and gone. A whole day devoted to everything JS and I must admit it was an information overload. From the talks that I saw here are my thoughts/views on a few of the talks.</p>

<h3 id="keynotetime">Keynote time</h3>

<p>So the morning talk was by Peter Paul-Koch (<a href="https://twitter.com/ppk">@ppk</a>), a great introduction on how touch events work on our mobile devices and desktops. The one quote I remember;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Stick with click</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As this isn't a mouse event more of an 'activate' event, it will work all the time and continue to work on all devices.</p>

<p>Peter dove a little deeper into the touch cascade event when your finger touches a mobile/device screen. Interesting to know how iOS fires all of these events:</p>

<ul>
<li>touchstart</li>
<li>touchend</li>
<li>mouseover</li>
<li>mousemove</li>
<li>mousedown</li>
<li>mouseup</li>
<li>click</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of these events it causes a 300ms delay in any action you try to make on a device.</p>

<p>With some of these events like hover it doesn't transcend very well in to mobile development. Some of his examples showed hover navigations going from A to B and failing at the last hurdle accessing an anchor tag. Obviously doing click events from A to B would solve this completely.</p>

<p>One thing I found interesting is how Microsoft are trying to converge events into simpler events. </p>

<p><em>Mousedown + Touchstart = pointerdown</em><br>
<em>Mousemove + Touchmove = pointermove</em><br>
<em>Mouseup + Touchend = pointerup</em></p>

<p>It made a lot of sense for browsers to be ubiquitous between touch and click events by turning them into pointer events, I mean your finger is a rough pointer in the end right?</p>

<h3 id="ghostbusting">Ghost busting!</h3>

<p>Presented by lead developer Hannah Wolfe (<a href="https://twitter.com/ErisDS">@ErisDS</a>), it was great to understand the insights of how a 3 man team went from concept, prototype and product. Reasons why they chose node.js to power this small but yet powerful blogging platform (yes I'm using Ghost), and how it made complete sense to go open source.</p>

<p>One area of all stuck out, the process to actually create their own guidelines, coding practices and testing ethos. This wasn't laboriously written out by candle light and branded in the minds of all who wished to develop on the platform. No, the keen interest from developers who teamed up with the Ghost team and collaborating with them directly made it easier to mould and channel any guidelines which suited all and produced a good feeling enviroment for all involved. </p>

<p>It felt that the platform was open source and the development ethos was an open source culture.</p>

<h3 id="leapinmotion3d">Leap in motion + 3D</h3>

<p>Mairead Buchan's (<a href="https://twitter.com/tiny_m">@tiny_m</a>) presented her findings on leap in motion. Very captivating from the start as I plan to start a little project my self creating a showcase.  I plan to use this little device to control and navigate the website through gestures and voice. </p>

<p>The talk showed how using WebGL + leap you are able to control and visualise your own hand and move each finger. This technology isn't 100% perfect as Mairead was able to show with certain arcs of movement break her hand rendering demo. None the less this is a movement into future technology which I hope we will see more of. </p>

<h3 id="multidevicesmultiplefun">Multi devices, multiple fun</h3>

<p>This talk had to be my favourite of all the talks at London JS. Ben Foxall (<a href="https://twitter.com/benjaminbenben">@benjaminbenben</a>) gave a great presentation on using multiple devices seamlessly. Harnessing the power of Websockets and WebRTC it was a very engaging talk between speaker and audience. Ben showed how he was able to collect large amounts of data from the audience who all connected to the same URL and projecting device data back to the audience asynchronously.</p>

<p>Another example was drawing a star via WebGL and recording that data by using Polling, Long Polling, Websockets and WebRCT. </p>

<p>Here we could see how this data connects to the server and can effect a constant stream of data (There is a great answer <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10028770/html5-websocket-vs-long-polling-vs-ajax-vs-webrtc">here</a> to explain the difference). I believe using three.js Ben was able to turn all four stars drawn into a graph and we were able to visualise the delays between all four data streams.</p>

<p>Last example blew my mind. After showing all devices connected and projecting a part of an image through to your device based on your position on the image. Ben connected two devices and being able to control and manipluate this image. Using both devices he was able to do a multidevice multitouch gesture with one finger on each device and doing a pinch to zoom. Mind = Blown!</p>

<h3 id="andthefinalthought">And the final thought</h3>

<p>All in all a great conference apart from the consistent projector issues, unfortunate reshuffle of two of the talks.</p>

<p>I think anyone who went to this will have been impressed with some of the tech out there we have at our disposal as web developers and would just want to play with all these awesome tools.</p>
